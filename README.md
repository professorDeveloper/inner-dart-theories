### The content may seem simple, but itâ€™s highly valuable for interview preparation, especially for those unfamiliar with Dartâ€™s internal mechanisms.

### Iâ€™m not a complete beginner myself, but I want to create a structured learning path starting from the absolute basics and progressing to advanced, interview-level concepts.

## Why this repository exists  

There are two main reasons behind creating this repository:  

- **Interview Preparation**  
  Strengthen your Dart knowledge for **challenging technical interviews**.  
  This repo goes beyond syntax â€” it dives deep into concepts, runtime behavior, and advanced use cases often tested in interviews.  

- **Academic Purpose**  
  Dart is taught **from scratch at my university**, and this repository is structured to align with that journey.  
  It goes beyond classroom material, providing a more **in-depth and practical perspective** for real-world development.

## ðŸ›  Who is this for?  

- Developers who know a bit of Dart but want to **go deeper**
- Students learning Dart **from scratch at university**
- Anyone preparing for **interviews where Dart/Flutter knowledge is tested**
- Self-learners who want a **structured, step-by-step Dart roadmap**
