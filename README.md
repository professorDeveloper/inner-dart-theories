## ðŸŒŸ Why this repository exists  

There are two main reasons behind creating this repository:  

- **ðŸŽ¯ Interview Preparation**  
  I aim to strengthen my Dart knowledge for **challenging technical interviews**.  
  This repo doesnâ€™t just stop at the syntax â€” it dives deeper into concepts, runtime behavior, and advanced use cases that are often tested in interviews.  

- **ðŸŽ“ Academic Purpose**  
  Dart is also being taught **from scratch at my university**, and this repository is structured to align with that journey.  
  However, it goes beyond classroom material, providing a more **in-depth and practical perspective** for real-world development.

## ðŸ›  Who is this for?  

- Developers who know a bit of Dart but want to **go deeper**  
- Students who are learning Dart **from scratch at university**  
- Anyone preparing for **interviews where Dart/Flutter knowledge is tested**
