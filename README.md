# Dart What? 
### The content may seem simple, but it’s highly valuable for interview preparation, especially for those unfamiliar with Dart’s internal mechanisms.

### I’m not a complete beginner myself, but I want to create a structured learning path starting from the absolute basics and progressing to advanced, interview-level concepts.

## 🌟 Why this repository exists  

There are two main reasons behind creating this repository:  

- **🎯 Interview Preparation**  
  I aim to strengthen my Dart knowledge for **challenging technical interviews**.  
  This repo doesn’t just stop at the syntax — it dives deeper into concepts, runtime behavior, and advanced use cases that are often tested in interviews.  

- **🎓 Academic Purpose**  
  Dart is also being taught **from scratch at my university**, and this repository is structured to align with that journey.  
  However, it goes beyond classroom material, providing a more **in-depth and practical perspective** for real-world development.

## 🛠 Who is this for?  

- Developers who know a bit of Dart but want to **go deeper**  
- Students who are learning Dart **from scratch at university**  
- Anyone preparing for **interviews where Dart/Flutter knowledge is tested**
